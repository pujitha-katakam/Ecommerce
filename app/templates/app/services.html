If the product returned by the user is used, damaged, or if the original tags are missing, the userâ€™s return request shall be declined, and the product shall be re-shipped back to the customer. If the return request is declined and the user fails to accept the receipt of the re-shipped product, the user shall not be eligible for a refund, and Snazzy assumes no liability in this regard. Additionally, these Terms of Use may be further supplemented by product-specific conditions displayed with each product.
